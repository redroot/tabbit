# Tabbit

Parse guitar tabs into actual notes. Very much WIP

### Examples

A few examples can be run if you fancy checkout the repo

**requires the Micromidi Gem and GarageBand**.

+ Open Garageband and select an instrument from a new song
+ cd in /examples and try out `stairway.rb` or `fadeout.rb`
